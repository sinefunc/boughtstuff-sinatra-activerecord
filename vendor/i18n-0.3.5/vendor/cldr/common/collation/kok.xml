<!--
The following tailoring is an adjustment of the
DUCET collation order for ANUSVARA, CANDRABINDU,
and VISARGA. Instead of being sorted with secondary
weights, they are collated on primary level before
the independent vowels. CANDRABINDU is secondary
different from ANUSVARA. This gives a sort order
similar to Hindi.
